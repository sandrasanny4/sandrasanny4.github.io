<p>You deserve a lover who wants you disheveled, with everything
and all the reasons that wake you up in a haste and the demons 
you that won’t let you sleep.
You deserve a lover who makes you feel safe, who 
can consume this world whole if he walks hand in hand 
with you; someone who believes that his embraces are a perfect match with your skin </p>
You deserve a lover who wants to dance with you, who goes to paradise every time he 
looks into your eyes and never gets tired of studying your expressions
You deserve a lover who listens when you sing, who supports you when you 
feel shame and respects your freedom; who flies with you and isn’t afraid tfall
 You deserve a lover who takes away the lies and brings you hope, coffee, and poetry.
